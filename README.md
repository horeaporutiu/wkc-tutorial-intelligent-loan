# Implement data governance to manage and secure clientsâ€™ data

It's no secret that data breaches are one of the worst ways
to reach the headlines, and that even one breach can mean an average cost of 3.9$ million. In the 
United States, the average data breach is much more costly than other countries, with the average 
breach costing over 8 million$. With data becoming more and more of a competitive advantage, the
process of organizing, managing, and securing your data is more important than ever. This is 
where a secure metadata management platform like Watson Knowledge Catalog comes in. At its core
Watson Knowledge Catalog (or WKC for short) connects data and knowledge with the people who need 
to use it.
